# Kodkollektivet

Goals of Kodkollektivet:
--------------------------

- A central point where committed students can be introduced to each other,
  solve problems, and be creative. The goals of Kodkollektivet is to give
  these students a place to work on both their own and external projects, as
  well as to provide a place where we can all learn from each other.

- To give members the opportunity of early-on experiences in fields that are
  relevant and makes them attractive to the modern market. This could include
  for instance, specific frameworks that are commonly used in practise but
  are not being taught in the university.

- Continuously working with external companies, building a network of
  connections that can benefit Kodkollektivet and its members. These benefits
  could be in the form of external, customer-based projects where members get
  to interact and work with a customer on a professional level.

- An easy way of building and showing off capabilities and experiences to
  future employers. One of the corner stones in Kodkollektivet is to always
  take pride in its members and what they have accomplished, both as a group
  and individually.

  As a member of Kodkollektivet, *credits must always be given publically* as a
  proof or reference to what each member has done or is capable of doing.
